## Description

If I state what kind of activity I want to do, and enter my location, I can see a range of activities that are available to me. When I enter a location, then I should also be able to see the local weather, based on the background image. This will then indicate to me whether my choice should be an indoor or outdoor activity. When I enter invalid or null location value, then I see an error message. When I click on "Familiar", then I see list of previously saved locations When I click on "Actually, let's clear these" button, then, my previously saved locations are removed, I could add new locations if I wish. When I click on previously saved locations, then no duplicate records are created in local storage
